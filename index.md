## I'm Yonas.

In case you don't know who I am (which should only be natural).

I travelled to 2020, in the middle of this great pandemic that's been going on for more than half a year, in order to find something. But instead, I lost someone. Her name is Mei, and she was part of the group that agreed to travel through the time machine. There were three of us, Rena was the one who operated the time machine. As we were in the middle of it, I was sitting in the darkness while Rena was in the other department trying to change the configuration of certain gears. Mei was sitting right across of me.

The next thing I realized, the sound of her breath disappeared. I called out her name, but she was not there anymore.

Rena told me not to panic, but at that moment I was already crying. Rena says there is very little chance that we can find Mei (insert scientific explanations). but we should at least try. Mei is an intelligent person, and I'm sure she's also trying to reach out to us.

Meanwhile, I should start acting on the plan to find the Spider, the reason of our travel from year 2070 back to this time when most of the human beings still live on earth.

I'm not sure where this path is leading me, but I hope everything will become clear at some point.

I will share the information I find with you, and please help me in this journey. It will be greatly appreciated.
